# Going Home

> Lyrics by Faby Nikson - 2022/04/20

```
I won’t come back home, I’ll enjoy my freedom

A Saturday feeling blue
I’m so bored.  What should I do? I can call the crew.
How about doing something new?
Don’t mind as long as I leave my fortress of empty dreams.

I feel the need to speak with y’all
Want someone to rely on, so that I feel whole, then I can be whole 
I need to feel the excitement
I need to live adventures & get away from my internment

I won’t come back home, there’s nothing to stand for

The thoughts that wait for me are putting me down
Sure some things need to be fought
Do I have enough strength to be tough?
If I tried to isolate and focus on my own
Will I figure out what's wrong
And be able to fix my soul

I would come back home to focus on my thoughts  

Now that I‘ve found you,
i’d be happy to find a place somewhere
we’ll build a new home there
Then we’ll be singing along:
"we are going home" cause you'll be my reason
We are going home, now we’re going home
```
