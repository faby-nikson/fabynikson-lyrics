# Good Old Times

> Faby Nikson - 07/01/2022

Do you remember good old times, when people were hanging out?
With no stress or need to rush, just chilling into their couch.
Taking time for each other, and enjoying where they were
Life seemed peace and troubleless, when they were with someone else.

The world has changed, this time is over. But was it better before?

**In silence, the world is under mutation
Constantly moving on, with no care for anyone.
In silence, following the evolution
Constantly moving on, we need to carry on.**

Do you remember good old times, when people judged only acts?
No matter what your look was, or what fortune you could have.
Knowing the value of every single moment.
They were cherishing their home, and enjoying what they had.

The world has changed, this time is over. But was it better before?
That’s what you keep saying all the time.
Is it a thing fixed in your mind, or… was it better before?

**In silence, the world is under mutation
Constantly moving on, with no care for anyone.
In silence, following the evolution
Constantly moving on...**

If you’re right, the world is over, we’ll never get better.
If you’re right, the world is over, we’ll never get better.
Iis it the sad story you want everyone to remember...
That it was better before?
