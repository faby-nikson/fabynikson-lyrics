# Feeling my dreams

> Mai 2011 - November 2020
> Capo 2 - 180bpm

```
As long as I remember
I've never been like this
Filled with the wish to travel
Through the differences

The road in front of me
I was feeling my dreams

**Chorus**
You can't give what I need
From my eyes
I don't see in any way you could help me

Since I've known you
My head is stuck in misery
Can't you understand 
this is too hard for me

Now I'm locked into my mind
Cause I'm not feeling my dreams

**Chorus**

Like a drug you addicted me to your memory
You're preventing me from realizing my dreams
You're destroying me. I just...
Got to stop hoping
I want to live in my dreams

**Chorus**

```
